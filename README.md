# Low-Light Image Enhancement with AI

This project focuses on enhancing low-light images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It includes data preprocessing, model training, and inference to achieve high-quality image enhancement.

## Features
- **Deep Learning Model**: Uses a CNN for low-light enhancement.
- **Preprocessing**: Normalizes and resizes images for training.
- **Real-Time Inference**: Processes test images and saves enhanced outputs.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/lowlight-project.git
